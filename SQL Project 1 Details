The SQL Project 1 is based on the data of COVID-10 Deaths and Vaccination.

This project serves as a valuable resource for understanding the 
dynamic interplay between COVID-19 dynamics and vaccination initiatives at the city level.
By leveraging SQL for data analysis, it provides a robust framework for future research and 
policymaking endeavors aimed at mitigating the impact of the ongoing pandemic.

COVID-19 Impact and Vaccination Analysis: City-Level Insights

This SQL project meticulously examines the intersection of COVID-19 impact and vaccination trends
across cities, employing comprehensive datasets on COVID-19 deaths and vaccination statistics. 
Through rigorous data cleaning and preparation, the project identifies cities most affected by the pandemic 
and evaluates the corresponding vaccination coverage. Utilizing SQL queries, it uncovers geographical 
disparities in COVID-19 impact and highlights regions with notable progress in vaccination campaigns. 
Comparative analyses offer valuable insights into the relationship between COVID-19 dynamics and vaccination rates, 
empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions. By integrating data visualization techniques, 
the project presents findings in an accessible format, facilitating comprehension and guiding strategic interventions. 
Ultimately, this project serves as a vital resource for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and communities,
offering actionable insights to combat the pandemic and accelerate vaccination efforts at the city level
