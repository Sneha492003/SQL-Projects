Project Title: Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

Description:
This project involves cleaning a dataset containing Nashville housing information to ensure data accuracy and consistency. 
The dataset encompasses various details such as property addresses, sale prices, and sale dates. By standardizing formats,
resolving missing values, and removing duplicates, the dataset is prepared for insightful analysis.

Key Steps:

Standardizing Dates: Converting sale dates to a uniform format enhances data coherence.
Populating Addresses: Missing property addresses are filled by cross-referencing Parcel IDs.
Address Breakdown: Dividing addresses into distinct components like street, city, and state streamlines analysis.
Standardizing Vacancy Status: Homogenizing the "Sold as Vacant" field clarifies vacant property status.
Removing Duplicates: Eliminating duplicate entries ensures data integrity and accuracy.
Unused Column Deletion: Removing irrelevant columns like OwnerAddress and TaxDistrict streamlines the dataset for analysis.


Usage:
The refined dataset is ready for a myriad of applications including predictive modeling, market trend analysis, and strategic decision-making within the Nashville housing sector.
